## About:
The idea behind Data Hub is to create a data pool in the field of data (from analysis to data scients) of qulity resources, that the comunity found useful and helpful while building projects, learning new skills, or just enjoyed reading.

Meaning, we don't keep every resorce we find, only the ones that we used and found helpful, informative, and clear enough for us to reuse in the future.

We give emphasis on personal expires so others would know they can relay on the resources, and to have many contributers sharing from thier on experience.

## How to use the Hub:
We have divided the Data Hub into mainstream data categories and general data-related resources.

The main categories: Reinforcement Learning, Vision, NLP, and General data-related resources.

In each one of those categories we have sub categories of the resurses: Courses, Tutorials & Guides, Articels & Papers, Books, Influencers To Follow.

So in order to find the right resourse, just jump into the relevent category and in the sub-caregories use what is best suited to you.

## Contribution

As mentioned above, this is an open-source project, meaning you get to be part of it!
In the link below you'll see the guidelines on how to donate a resource to our pool :)
Keep in mind, that the whole idea is not to throw whatever we can find on the internet, but rather gather quality resources that you tried for yourself and found useful.

So click on the link, share your resources, and help others in their journey.
